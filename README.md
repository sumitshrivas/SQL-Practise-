# SQL-Practise-
This repository contains my SQL practice queries based on the popular Music Store (Chinook) database. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of SQL concepts such as joins, filtering, aggregation, grouping, and ordering, which are essential for data analysis and software development roles.
